## 5. ‚úÖ Unity UI Requirements

You need to create a UI like the image (if provided), with:

- One button for **GET Request**
- One button for **POST Request**
- Each button should call:
  - `RequestGet()` for GET
  - `RequestPost()` for POST
- A **Text field** for displaying the response

‚ö†Ô∏è If **TextMeshPro (TMPro)** is not supported, use a standard **UI Text** component instead.
